# statstitute

A program to generate the information required by the [`Tilde Description Protocol`](http://protocol.club/~datagrok/beta-wiki/tdp.html).
This is aimed at social UNIX boxes referred to as `tildes`, but is created for [`tilde.institute`](https://tilde.institute).

The branch `only_user_count` omits user-specific data in favor of just a user count. This is the mode of operation for [`tilde.institute`](https://tilde.institute)

It's kind of a rite-of-passage for a `tildeverse` member box to have its own script to generate this data, but I'm putting it up
here in case anyone else wants to use it.
